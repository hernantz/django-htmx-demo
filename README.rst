Example Application
===================

This project was extracted from the demo app in the
`django-htmx <https://github.com/adamchainz/django-htmx>`_ app.

It adds the `preload <https://htmx.org/extensions/preload/>`_ + ``hx-boost``
extension and the `Nprogress <https://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/>`_ plugin to show the loading indicator for all ajax
requests.

Install
-------

.. code-block:: sh

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install -U pip
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   DEBUG=1 python manage.py runserver


Open it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ .

Browse the individual examples, and take them apart!

In your browser’s devtools, you can read the htmx `debug log <https://htmx.org/extensions/debug/>`__ in your browser’s console, and see the requests made in the network tab.
In the source code, check out the HTML comments via “view source” or templates, and the view code in ``example/core/views.py``.
